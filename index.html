                    Amid the ongoing rescue and search operations due to the devastating landslide in Kerala’s 
                    Wayanad, a  survivor  named <br> Sujatha Aninanchira has revealed how she and her family narrowly escaped 
                    a near-death situation when their home was <br> buried in the Chooralmala landslides. <br><br>
                    The rescue and search operations have intensified with nearly over 250 people still missing. 
                    Moreover, the death toll has <br> reached 341, as the rescue efforts enter the fifth day on Saturday, 
                    according to a Manoramaonline report. <br><br>

In a dramatic turn of events, Aninanchira climbed to a nearby hill but encountered a group of wild elephants.
 These tuskers are <br> usually known for their aggressive behaviour, but in this case, these animals surprisingly 
 showed their affectionate and caring  <br>side.

            <p>he toll in Wayanad rose to 221 on Sunday, as rescue personnel from various agencies
                 continued their search for landslide <br> victims under the debris of three villages flattened on
                  the morning on July 30. <br><br>
                  A release from the chief minister’s said that apart from the dead, 172 body parts were also 
                  retrieved from the affected areas, <br> and from the Chaliyar river in neighbouring Malappuram district.

Rescue personnel from the army, NDRF, Kerala fire <br>and rescue services, Coast Guard, civil defence volunteers
 and locals continued to scan various parts of the Chooralmala, <br> Mundakkai and Punchirimattom villages using
  advanced equipment and modern sensors for sign of survivors and remains <br> of victims. <br><br>

Multiple landslides, within a space of three hours, early on July 30 flattened the three villages which housed over
 400 <br>buildings including homes, mosques, temples, schools and shops.The state has also started the process of collecting
  blood <br>samples from the kin of the dead in order to help identify the bodies and body parts through DNA tests. <br><br>

 Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the model of rehabilitation implemented in the aftermath of the 2019 Puthumala <br>
  landslide, in which 17 people died, will form the basis of the rehabilitation plan now.
